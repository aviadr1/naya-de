For fitting a model we've used a sample of the data we called the **train** set and for assessing the model we've used the rest of the data - the **test** set. Using a single model based on a single sampling of the data may have some problems. We can improve a model, increase its validity and reduce the variance of its predictions by applying multiple models for the same problem and then consider all the outcomes for the final resolution. Such a collection of models is called **ensemble**, and it has two main flavors: averaging and boosting.\n","\n","The **averaging** approach is very intuitive. You fit many models and take a decision based on all the results. One of the advantages of this approach is that it can be easily parallelized. In this context we will learn about **Voting** and **Bagging** (**B**ootstrap **agg**regation).\n","\n","The **boosting** approach is more complicated. The boosting algorithm starts with a **weak** version of a given **base** model and iteratively improves its measures by applying a sequence of modifications to its hyperparameters. In this context we will learn about **AdaBoost** (**Ada**ptive **boost**ing) and **Gradient boosting**.\n","\n","All the ensemble methods are gathered together under the module [_sklearn.ensemble_][ensemble], and they all share the usual API, which in this case is a wrapping of a much more complex actions.\n","\n","[ensemble]:
