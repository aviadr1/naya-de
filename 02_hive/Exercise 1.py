In this exercise we will create a CSV file with specific data from the customers table by following these steps:

1. Write an SQL query for customers whose number is between 124 and 131 (or any reasonable alternative)
2. Fetch the data from the table into a list of records.
3. Instantiate a DataFrame with the data and use the to_csv() method to creat the file.
